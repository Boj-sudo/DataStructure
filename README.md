# Trying to fix the load shedding using Data Structure

##Introduction

Load shedding is a  measure of last resort to prevent the collapse of power system country-wide
Load shedding happens when there is not enough electricity available to meet the demand of all customers.
Since we all saw south Africa as a nation  suffered from this blackout then I thought if we can come up with solutions to lower the amount of load shedding by  constructing the additional power stations and provide new generators, also the use of renewable energy because when there is insufficient power station capacity to supply the demand from all the customers, the electricity system becomes unbalanced which cause it to trip out country-wide and which could take days to restore.

##Problem
The problem is that when there is insufficient power station capacity to supply the demand from all the customers, the electricity system becomes unbalanced which can cause it to shut out the country wide and which could take days to restore.
When there is load shedding , compatriots suffer because the networks are switched off
Load shedding is a real problem in the developing and emerging markets and takes a big hit on the economy.

##Solution
Vertex represent vehicles(trucks) and for new generators.
Edges represent weight and costs of coals.
Traversals represent the path with the smallest amount of coals, the actual traversals will be transporting enough and balanced electricity in the housing from power stations.

Conclusion
In conclusion I couldnâ€™t manage to achieve what I intended to do to solve the issue of loadshedding(blackout) but still working on it in attempt to solve the problem.
